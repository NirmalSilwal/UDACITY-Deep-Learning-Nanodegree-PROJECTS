:dog: Image classification project to **identify the breed of Dog**. If dog is detected it will **predict breed of the dog**. 

:boy: If human is detected it will return *resembling dog breed*. :woman:

:computer: It uses **Convolutional Neural Network**, both from scratch & using *transfer learning (resnet50)*.

## Sample output
```diff
 1. When Dog is given for prediction: 
```
